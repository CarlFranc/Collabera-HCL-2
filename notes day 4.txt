Guest Add to cart vs Registered User add to cart (calls OrderItemMove command controller upon login)
-Guest users adding to cart will have member ID on its own
-ORDERS_ID will be created for all the items the guest user has added to cart
	-ORDERS_ID is like the cart id and individual items are order_id without S
-if the guest user decided to login then all the contents of the cart will be merged with the cart of the registered user
-then a new orders_id will be generated bound to the registered user
-then it will have status of P which is pending
-the orders_id of the guest user will have status of X which is ready for purging in DB

Order item states
P (pending) -> M (payment) -> C (when order and payment is approved or confirmed) -> H (when the order is sent to fullfilment system) -> G (when fullfilment systems says it has received the order)
X (means deleted or marked to be deleted by cron job)
